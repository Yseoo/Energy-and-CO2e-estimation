    "This programming exercise is focused on machine learning (ML) bias in applications. The exercise involves designing a ML model to predict whether an individual's income is above or below $50,000 based on demographic and employment-related features such as age, education level, and occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for training the model is the Adult Income dataset, which contains information about individuals' demographic and employment-related features, as well as their income level. In this exercise, you will preprocesses the data, train a ML model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as F1 score and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise also highlights the issue of bias in machine learning, and how it can lead to unequal treatment or discrimination against certain demographic groups. Specifically, the exercise focuses on the bias observed in the model's performance on different demographic groups, such as 'Male' and 'White' compared to 'Female' and 'Black'. The exercise demonstrates how bias can arise in ML models, and emphasizes the importance of addressing bias to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all individuals and groups."
