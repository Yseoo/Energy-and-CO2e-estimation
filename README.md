# Energy-and-CO2e-estimation, ML bias

This repository correspond to the final project in the [HUM-433: How people learn: Designing Learning Tools II](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/how-people-learn-designing-learning-tools-ii-HUM-433).
We present ressources to address ethical concern in computer science field, mainly the **energy consumption and CO2e footprint** and the **bias in machine learning algorithms**.

The project is composed of two jupter-notebook with coding activities and two real-life case studies. Each one of the case study work together with a jupyter notebook to address
one of the two topics we chose.

The activites are made to be done in the following order : 1st the energy related activities, then the ML bias activities. The first jupyter notebook contains a quick introduction
to jupyter notebook, pandas and sklearn.
